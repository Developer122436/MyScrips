00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Anthony] When it comes to business software

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,006
that is used around the world by companies big and small,

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,009
nothing quite compares to the popularity

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,005
and reach of Microsoft Excel.

5
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:12,006
Excel is the most important and most used software

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:14,008
in business today, and mastery of it

7
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:17,005
is expected in most work places.

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,001
But managing Excel data can often be

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,001
tedious and repetitive.

10
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,004
This is where Python comes in.

11
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:27,000
Python is the fastest growing programming language,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,008
and when you pair Python with Excel,

13
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,004
you unlock powerful tools that not only lighten

14
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:34,006
your workload, but also allow you to do more,

15
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,009
helping your team, or your company,

16
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,006
get to the next level.

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,006
My name is Anthony Sagely, and I'm passionate

18
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,009
about data science.

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,007
I teach Python and Excel, and I use these programs daily

20
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,008
to help businesses find efficiencies,

21
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:51,001
automate tasks, and ultimately, solve problems.

22
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,006
In this course, I'm going to show you how you can use

23
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,002
Python with Excel.

24
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,007
I'll show you how you can analyze large amounts of data

25
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,003
in Python that would be hard to manage in Excel,

26
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,005
how to import and work with reports,

27
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,005
as well as how to use both of these programs

28
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,002
to generate powerful data visualizations.

29
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,004
By the end of this course, you'll feel confident

30
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,006
to start using Python with Excel.

31
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,002
So, if you're ready to jump in, let's go.
