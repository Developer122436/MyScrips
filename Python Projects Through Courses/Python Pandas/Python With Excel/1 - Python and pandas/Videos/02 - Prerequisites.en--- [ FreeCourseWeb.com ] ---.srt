00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,005
- [Instructor] So what do you need to know to get the most

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:03,007
out of this course?

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,006
Well prior to this course, I expect you to have some

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
basic knowledge in Python and in programming.

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,009
This is a basic to intermediate course and we won't be going

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,004
over how to create variables or indent.

7
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,005
You should have Python installed.

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,005
Known syntax, and know other basics like loops

9
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,008
and conditionals.

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:24,003
Other than that, the only thing that's really required

11
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,007
is Excel.

12
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,005
I'll be running this on the Windows operating system,

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,001
I'll also be running our cord through Visual Studio Code

14
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,002
and its provided terminal, but you can run yours

15
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,007
through any text editor.

16
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:39,002
All of the files we'll be going over for examples will be

17
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,008
included with this course.
