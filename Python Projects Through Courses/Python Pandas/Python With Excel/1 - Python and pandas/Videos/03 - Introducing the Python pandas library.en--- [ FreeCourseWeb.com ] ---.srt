00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] When working with Excel,

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:02,009
there are many tools available

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,009
that allow interaction with Python.

4
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,002
One of the most popular tools is Pandas.

5
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,003
The Pandas library,

6
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,005
which is used primarily for data science,

7
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,000
makes it super easy for us to examine, sort,

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,001
or modify any data, even from Excel.

9
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,005
But how does it do that?

10
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,007
Pandas essentially creates a spreadsheet for us

11
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,000
in our Python code called the dataframe.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,008
This dataframe has indexed rows and header columns

13
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,000
that both store what's called a series.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The series stores all the values in the rows and columns,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,005
almost like the list.

16
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,007
Because both these objects are iterable,

17
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:37,000
Pandas makes it easy to traverse and pick up the data.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,002
Using the dataframe,

19
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:41,002
we can do any kind of analysis or grouping we'd want

20
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,009
and export it to an Excel.

21
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,001
Before we jump in, let's get Panda set up

22
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,008
via the Pip installer in our command prompt.

23
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,003
For my system specifically,

24
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:54,005
I need to run pi dash M, pip install pandas.

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,000
As you can see, I already have it.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,002
Now, let's open up Python in our terminal.

27
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,007
If we import Pandas and press Enter,

28
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,004
we see no errors and that means Pandas

29
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,006
was installed correctly.
