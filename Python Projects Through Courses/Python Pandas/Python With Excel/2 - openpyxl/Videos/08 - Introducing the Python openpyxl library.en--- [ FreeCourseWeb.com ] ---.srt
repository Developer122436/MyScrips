00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] If you've ever found yourself stuck

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:05,000
with the boring task of constantly reading over spreadsheets

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for certain data,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,004
copying and pasting to new Excel documents,

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:10,005
or just trying to make your data look good,

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,002
then Openpyxl is the library for you.

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,000
Openpyxl is a package in Python

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,008
that allows our code to interact

9
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,009
directly with Excel documents.

10
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,001
With Openpyxl,

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,000
we gain the freedom to manipulate

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,009
not just the data in the spreadsheet,

13
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,002
but the properties of the spreadsheet itself.

14
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,001
It does this by storing an Excel workbook

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,008
as well as the worksheets

16
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,008
as objects that we can alter with our code.

17
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,008
Openpyxl is the most used module

18
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,008
for dealing specifically with Excel,

19
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:39,001
as it allows us to do anything from styling sheets

20
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,009
to parsing data or creating graphs.

21
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,002
Before we get started,

22
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,000
we need to make sure that Openpyxl

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,002
is installed to our command prompt.

24
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:52,009
Running the pip install command,

25
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,005
we see that I already have it.

26
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,004
Next, let's open up our Python module.

27
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,000
When we import Openpyxl and press Enter,

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,003
if no errors appear,

29
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:04,000
then we've installed successfully.
