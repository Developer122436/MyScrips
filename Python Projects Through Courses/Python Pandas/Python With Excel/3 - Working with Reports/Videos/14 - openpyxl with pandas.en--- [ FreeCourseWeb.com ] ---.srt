00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Teacher] Pandas and Openpyxl

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,005
are powerful tools in their own right.

3
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,004
But they both have their shortcomings.

4
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,001
However, they support integration with each other.

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,000
And, when you use them both together,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,003
they help cover for the other's weaknesses.

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:15,004
Openpyxl is great for all kinds of visualization

8
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,001
and basic Excel work.

9
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,009
But when it comes to large datasets, it's fairly slow.

10
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,007
Because Pandas doesn't have to deal

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,009
with the visualization

12
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,009
and working directly with Excel as much,

13
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,002
it can take on extremely large datasets

14
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,008
and perform analysis extremely fast.

15
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,001
So, once we have both of these libraries installed via pip,

16
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,000
let's jump in.
