00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,009
- If you've made it all the way to this video,

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:03,007
congrats on finishing the course.

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,004
Python supports an ever growing community of developers

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,008
and more tools are added constantly.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,009
We covered the basics here, but there are always

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,006
more to learn, so here are a few basic resources

7
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:14,007
I recommend.

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,009
First, check out the documentation for both OpenPyxl,

9
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,006
and Pandas library, as they go very in depth

10
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,001
for all their functionality.

11
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,003
You can find them on their respective sites.

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,005
As you continue to build a base in Python,

13
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,008
and check out the opportunities that it offers,

14
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,001
check out the book called "Automate the Boring Stuff

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,000
with Python", by Al Sweigart.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,005
In this book he covers the basics of Python

17
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,004
all the way to automating daily operations

18
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,008
that make your life easier.

19
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,002
And the book also features a chapter on Excel.

20
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,007
I encourage you to take your time and learn more

21
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,000
Python skills as it's a powerful tool

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,005
for your everyday troubles.

23
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,003
Good luck.
