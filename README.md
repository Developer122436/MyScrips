# MyScrips
I created all my projects with Python by myself and part of my work in courses.

I used a lot of automatic tasks and graphs on multiple libraries to make an analysis automatically.

I have a script on the codes that restart my computer, convert PDF to CSV on my project, send happy birthday at 12 AM to the WhatsApp list of my friends in Excel file,

check the API of the weather site and send me a notification if had rain to my WhatsApp every 6 AM, 

check keywords on CV files that indicate if the CV qualified for the job through NLP,

check data and organize it to CSV files through Jupyter files - The data is taken from Google trends, google play apps and more.

Libraries used in projects:
Pandas, Maptlolib, Seaboan, Sklearn, Numpy, Selenium, Jupyter, Smtplib, OS, Request, Plotly & NLP
