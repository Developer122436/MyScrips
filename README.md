I created all my projects with Python and part of my work in the course.

I used a lot of automatic tasks and graphs on multiple libraries to make an analysis automatically.

I developed a script in Python that restarted my computer, converted PDF to CSV on my project, sent Happy Birthday at midnight to the WhatsApp list of my friends in an Excel file,

check the API of the weather site and send me a notification if it rains to my WhatsApp every 6 AM, 

check keywords on CV files that indicate if the CV qualified for the job through NLP,

check data and organize it into CSV files through Jupyter files - The data is taken from Google Trends, Google Play apps, and more.

Libraries used in projects:
Pandas, Maptlolib, Seaboan, Sklearn, Numpy, Selenium, Jupyter, Smtplib, OS, Request, Plotly & NLP
